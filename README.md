# hello-world
The start of adventure

I'm a millennial (aka generation Y) who is no stranger to smart devices but still remember CRT monitors and floppy disks. This means that I, and people in my generation, experienced first-hand how the bullhorns got passed around from media conglomerates to bloggers to social media on the Internet. Along the way, this site is like my spiritual resort in the era of information overload, where I can always return to examine what went well, what didn't and everything in between.
